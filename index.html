                Most cancer patients experience conditions that adversely affect their quality of life. Cancer treatments like surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, hormonal therapy, CAR-T and stem cell transplant can be difficult to endure and require your life to change for a period of time.

            <p class="mt-4 mx-2"style="font-size: 1.25rem;">I am a registered nurse (BSN) and a certified health and life coach. My specialty is oncology, and I have been working in cancer care for over a decade. I have worked in acute inpatient hospital settings, clinic settings, and infusion settings. I am chemotherapy certified and transplant certified, and I have experience with a wide range of cancer treatments. 
              <br><br>What I love most about nursing is supporting my patients. Over the course of my career as an oncology nurse, I have had the privilege of working with some incredible people, even though I am often meeting them in some of the most challenging seasons of their lives. I have been honored by their trust, and find great meaning in caretaking, teaching, encouraging, and bearing witness to their journeys, especially when they are doing the hard things involved in cancer treatment and recovery.
              <br><br>In my own life, I try to practice what I preach as a healthcare professional. I love creating delicious vegetarian meals from healthful ingredients, because I know how important it is to give my body good fuel. I stay fit and keep my body strong with regular exercise, including boxing, weight-lifting, and hiking. I love to ski in the winter, and paddle on my SUP in the summer.  I tend to my emotional and spiritual health as well by reading, writing, singing, meditating, and talking with my loved ones and my own coach.

            <p class="mt-4 mx-2"style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Because of the way our current healthcare system works, with high nurse-to-patient ratios and insurance reimbursement imposing time limits on provider visits, there are often gaps left in patient care. A nurse coach fills those gaps. Conventional treatment permits <span style="font-weight: bold;">only enough time to treat the illness, but not enough time to heal the person.</span> A nurse coach is able to come alongside you, supporting you as you face the difficulties of treatment, giving you space to process your emotions, and guiding you as you look forward to the future. 
              <br>
              <br>
              A <span style="font-weight: bold;">nurse</span> can help you understand your health better. A nurse can help you understand your medications and how to take them. A nurse can help you adjust your diet so that it is working congruently with your medical plan. A nurse can help you develop a safe exercise plan. 
              <br>
              <br>
              A <span style="font-weight: bold;">coach</span> can help you develop a routine to make new habits last. A coach can offer you support and accountability over a longer period of time. A coach can help you identify what motivates you so you can stick to your treatment plan. A coach can help you identify and move past self-limiting beliefs and behaviors. A coach can help you find out what health looks like for you! 
              <br>
              <br>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">Health is not one-size-fits-all.</span> Health is not only physical, it’s mental, emotional, spiritual, financial, industrial, relational, cultural. What does being healthy look like for you? 
              A nurse coach can help you set achievable goals for your life, during and after treatment. A nurse coach can empower you to put yourself first and see how it will uplift and positively impact those around you.

              “Professional nurse coaching is a skilled, purposeful, results-oriented, and structured relationship and a person-centered interaction with a healthcare consumer that is provided by a baccalaureate-prepared or advanced practice registered nurse for the purpose of promoting achievement of a person’s goals.”
              “Achievement of the person’s goals is accomplished by first establishing a co-creative partnership with the individual, acknowledging that they are the expert in their own care. The nurse sets aside the expert role and instead assists the person to identify and prioritize desired areas for change. Thus, goals originate from clarifying and identifying the person’s agenda.”

              The goal of this session will be to establish a safe space in which to explore your feelings, answer your questions, discuss your needs, and set a clear path toward health.
